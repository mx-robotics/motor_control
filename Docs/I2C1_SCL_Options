####Option 1: Sacrifise HWSerial-UART (Best option imo)

This way, we can connect to the Pi/UpBoard via I2C to any number of Teensyies and we can **still** have native USB connection if needed.

(+) UART is not a bus so even if we keep it to communicate with Pi/UpBoard we will still use I2C to communicate with other Teensys. 
(-) UART is very easy to use on 1-to-1 communications.


#### Option 2: Sacrifise SPI_MOSI ( RISKY but viable)
It is possible to get rid of SPI MOSI, which will but the sensor to a read only mode that only sends angle info when prompted.

(+)Lets us keep everything and also all the functionality
(-) It should work but dont have the means to try it.

#### Option 3: Sacrife IMU connection to MCU (Complex communication scheme)
We can directly connect the IMU to the Pi/Upboard and do the computation there. We cancel the second I2C, use the first one to communicate between Teensys.

IMU (I2C_1) -> Pi/UpBoard -> (UART) -> Teensy1 -> (I2C_2) -> Teensy2
(-) We sacrife a functionality that might be necessary.
(+) Second Teensy doesnt need a second IMU

#### Option 4: Put the second Teensy and IMU to the same I2C bus. ( BAD IDEA, Complex communication scheme )

We cancel second I2C. The commnication looks like this:

Pi/UpBoard -> (UART) - > 1. Teensy -> (I2C) -> IMU -> (I2C) -> 2. Teensy
